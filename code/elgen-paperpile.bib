  abstract    = "The immature retina generates spontaneous waves of spiking
                 activity that sweep across the ganglion cell layer during a
                 limited period of development before the onset of visual
                 experience. The spatiotemporal patterns encoded in the waves
                 are believed to be instructive for the wiring of functional
                 connections throughout the visual system. However, the
                 ontogeny of retinal waves is still poorly documented as a
                 result of the relatively low resolution of conventional
                 recording techniques. Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal
                 features of mouse retinal waves from birth until eye opening
                 in unprecedented detail using a large-scale, dense,
                 4096-channel multielectrode array that allowed us to record
                 from the entire neonatal retina at near cellular resolution.
                 We found that early cholinergic waves propagate with random
                 trajectories over large areas with low ganglion cell
                 recruitment. They become slower, smaller and denser when GABAA
                 signalling matures, as occurs beyond postnatal day (P) 7.
                 Glutamatergic influences dominate from P10, coinciding with
                 profound changes in activity dynamics. At this time, waves
                 cease to be random and begin to show repetitive trajectories
                 confined to a few localized hotspots. These hotspots gradually
                 tile the retina with time, and disappear after eye opening.
                 Our observations demonstrate that retinal waves undergo major
                 spatiotemporal changes during ontogeny. Our results support
                 the hypotheses that cholinergic waves guide the refinement of
                 retinal targets and that glutamatergic waves may also support
                 the wiring of retinal receptive fields.",
