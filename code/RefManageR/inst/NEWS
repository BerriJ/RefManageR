Changes in Version 0.9.0 (2014-08-30)
---------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* BibEntry objects can be printed in `YAML` format if `pandoc-citeproc` is available
* `Cite` functions can now print citations in format read by `pandoc` and `RMarkdown`

`pandoc`.  One of the main uses of this is support for `CSL` citation formats.

Boettiger)

Changes in Version 0.8.3 (2014-07-30)
---------------------------------------------------------

packages with `citation`.
* PrintBibliography and Cite functions (Cite, Citet, etc.) accept `bibentry` objects in addition to
`BibEntry` objects.
* `$<-.BibEntry` will now accept a single person object, so that a single author in a multi-author entry
