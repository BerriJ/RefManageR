Description: RefManageR provides tools for importing and working with
    bibliographic references.  It greatly enhances the bibentry class by
    providing a class BibEntry which stores BibTeX and BibLaTeX references,
    supports UTF-8 encoding, and can be easily searched, combined, printed in a
    number of styles, and exported.  Interfaces to NCBI's Entrez, CrossRef, and
    Zotero are provided for importing references and references can be created
    from locally stored PDFs using Poppler.
