# Contributing to RefManageR

The following is modified from the [plotly contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Opening issues

When reporting an issue please provide a reproducible example.  You
may find the package [reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex)
useful for this.

## Development Guidelines

If you'd like to contribute changes to RefManageR, see [the GitHub
flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for
proposing, submitting, reviewing, and accepting changes. If you
haven't done this before, Hadley Wickham provides a nice overview of
git (<http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html>), as well as best practices
for submitting pull requests
(<http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#pr-make>). I also recommend using
his style guide when writing code
(<http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html>).  If your pull request fixes a
bug, or implements a new feature, it's a good idea to write a test
(<http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html>) to demonstrate it's working.
